// Module 1 - Using Pseudocode Statements and Flowchart Symbols

// Exercise 1: Compute the number of miles per gallon you get with your car.
gas tank size = integer
miles driven = integer
miles per gallon = gas tank size / miles driven
print(miles per gallon)

// Exercise 2: Describe computing the daily cost of your rent in a 30-day month. 
monthly rent = integer
month = "string"
days in month = integer
// There are two different ways of accomplishing this program. For something 
// simple, you can manually declare each month with the number of days.
// You can also create an if, else if, and else statement to parse through
// which month was declared in the month variable. You can either use the name or 
// you can use the number of the month. 
daily cost = monthly rent / days in month
print(daily cost)

// Exercise 3: A program that shows available discretionary spending.
monthly pay = integer
rent = integer
utilities = integer
grocery bills = integer
// Discretionary spending will be declared by writing a simple algorithm that
// adds rent, utilities, and grocery bills together and then subtracts the total
// from monthly pay. 
total bills = rent + utilities + grocery bills
discretionary spending = monthly pay - total bills
print(total bills)
print(discretionary spending)
